    title: 'Unprotected Bike Paths on Truck Routes in NYC',
    subtitle: 'Truck routes can be dangerous places for bikers. However, truck routes are essential for the city and allow for the movement of goods. Often times, GPS apps direct cyclists to use truck route streets that have unprotected bike lanes or "sharrows."',

            description: 'Many of these accidents occur on "sharrows" which are road markings indicating that cars and bicycles must share a lane. Two cyclists were killed last year riding in sharrows. Sharrows made up a large portion of the 400 miles of "bike lanes" created during the Bloomberg administration. Some argue that sharrows do nothing to protect cyclists and could also cause greater danger. This is because GPS apps will prefer to send riders down these streets instead of streets without any bike markings. A rider was struck by a truck on this road last year by a box truck. ',
