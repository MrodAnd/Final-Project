    subtitle: 'Truck routes can be dangerous places for bikers. However, truck routes are essential for the city and allow for the movement of goods. What is incredibly dangerous is when GPS apps direct cyclists to use streets with trucks which occurs frequently for streets that have "shallows."',

Two cyclists were killed last year riding in sharrows. Many argue that sharrows do nothing to protect cyclists and could also cause greater danger. This is because GPS apps will prefer to send riders down these streets instead of streets without any bike markings. However sharrows on truck routes have shown to be extremely dangerous. A rider was struck by a truck on this road last year by a box truck. ',
